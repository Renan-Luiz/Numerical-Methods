# Numerical-Methods

In this repository there are two programs, temperature_distribution.py and heat_equation.py.

In temperature_distribution.py, the temperature distribution in a bar can be solved by using one of three following numerical methods: 
explicit euler, implicit euler and Crank-Nicolson method. 



The heat_equantion.py is intended to predict the heat source by assuming that the temperature distribution is already known.
