# Numerical-Methods

In this repository there are two programs, temperature_distribution.py and heat_equation.py.

In temperature_distribution.py, the temperature distribution problem in a bar can be solved by using one of three following numerical methods: 
explicit euler, implicit euler and Crank-Nicolson method. 

The bar is discretized into N nodes and the time is discretized into M steps. 
It has Î» as method convergence limit.

The problem schema is the following:

the problem equation can be seen bellow:

The temperature distribution program has to be used in the following steps:
--
* Run the code
* Type:
   1 to use explicit euler method
   2 to use implicit euler
   3 to use Crank-Nicolson method
* 


The heat_equantion.py is intended to predict the heat source by assuming that the temperature distribution is already known.
